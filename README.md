### üîç Similarity Search on Text Data using FAISS

**üìå Overview:** Text data can be converted into embeddings using models like Word2Vec, TF-IDF, or BERT. These embeddings can be indexed in FAISS for fast similarity search.

**üìñ Step-by-step Guide:**

1. **Data Preprocessing**: First, you need to collect your text data. This could be in the form of documents, articles, or any other textual data. Ensure that each document is preprocessed properly by removing stop words (common words like 'the', 'and', 'is'), punctuation, and converting all text to lowercase for consistency.

2. **Tokenization**: Tokenize your text into individual words or subwords. This will help you break down the text into smaller manageable pieces.

3. **Vectorization**: To make text data suitable for similarity search using FAISS, you need to convert it into vector form. One popular method is using Word2Vec or BERT embeddings. These methods convert words into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning.

   For Word2Vec, you can use Gensim library in Python:
   ```python
   from gensim.models import Word2Vec
   model = Word2Vec(sentences=corpus, vector_size=100)  # Adjust vector_size to your requirement
   ```

4. **Indexing**: After vectorizing your data, you can create an index using FAISS library. The index is a data structure that allows efficient similarity search. There are several types of indices available in FAISS, but for text data, usually the `FlatL2` or `IVFClassifier` indices are used.

   Here's an example of creating an index with FlatL2:
   ```python
   from faiss import StandardGpuResources, IndexFlatL2

   resources = StandardGpuResources()
   index = IndexFlatL2(vector_dim=100, metric_type="L2")  # Adjust vector_dim to your vector size
   index.train(data)  # data is your vectorized text data
   index.save('index.faiss')
   ```

5. **Searching**: To perform a search, you can load the previously saved index and query with new vectors:
   ```python
   index = IndexFlatL2.load('index.faiss', resources=resources)
   query_vector = model.wv['new_query']  # Replace 'new_query' with your actual query
   topk_indices, distances = index.search(query_vector, k=5)  # Search top 5 similar documents
   ```
   The `topk_indices` will contain the indices of the most similar documents in your original dataset, and `distances` will contain the L2 distance between the query vector and each of these vectors.
